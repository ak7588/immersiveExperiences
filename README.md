Final project Google Cardboard VR

# Progress logs

## June 9th:

### Summary:
- started playing with Three.JS
- outlined basics of the first scene

### Findings:
- cardboard button can communicate with the three.js!
- camera can move like in [this](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_effects_anaglyph.html) anaglyph example, but we will only add it after the MVP
- dynamic change of colors like [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_framebuffer_texture.html)
- glowing effect [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_geometry_dynamic.html)

Amina's progress:
- explored with animation options for the 3D scene
- found stuff to implement from the initial idea/inspo for the 3D scene:

### To Do for next time:
- explore shadows to show scene 1, where brightness depends on the distance
- unsure of how to proceed from scene 1 to scene 2. solution: playtest and get feedback
- concept polishing: scene/level 1 -> you fail -> scene/level 2 -> you learn -> scene/level 3 -> you understand -> scene/level 1 -> win!
- cool thing about concept: progress isn't linear and you don't always have to increment. sometimes to progress you need to go back and re-do something!
- think of the specific tasks to proceed from level to level
- add event listeners for single, double, and long click on the cardboard for better interaction
