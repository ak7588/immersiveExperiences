Final project Google Cardboard VR

# Progress logs

## June 9th:

### Summary:
- started playing with Three.JS
- outlined basics of the first scene

### Findings:
- cardboard button can communicate with the three.js!
- camera can move like in [this](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_effects_anaglyph.html) anaglyph example, but we will only add it after the MVP
- dynamic change of colors like [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_framebuffer_texture.html)

Amina:
- explore with animation options for the 3D scene

### To Do for next time:
- explore shadows to show scene 1, where brightness depends on the distance
- unsure of how to proceed from scene 1 to scene 2. solution: playtest and get feedback
- concept idea: scene 1 - you fail - scene 2 - you learn - scene 3 - you understand - scene 1 - win!
